## Part 1 - Design for Stream Analytics

<br>
<br>

1. As a tenant, select a dataset suitable for streaming data analytics as a running scenario. Explain the dataset and why the
dataset is suitable for streaming data analytics in your scenario. As a tenant, present at least two different analytics in the
interest of the tenant: (i) a streaming analytics (tenantstreamapp) which analyzes streaming data from the tenant and (ii) a
batch analytics which analyzes historical results outputted by the streaming analytics. The explanation should be at a high
level to allow us to understand the data and possible analytics so that, later on, you can implement and use them in
answering other questions.
